# Peer Testing Session #2 Feedback

**General Likes**

- Very cohesive design, all pages looks similarly and act similarly with same style
- Responsive
- Not much going back and forth between pages, (nearly) all accessible at once
- Options are easy to find for login logout, creation/edit/delete
- Great feedback on incorrect filling of fields

**General Dislikes**

- Length of pages (can’t be changed)
- Feedback for certain buttons
- Lack of save all feature in dashboard on each page
- Role field resets when a popup is returned for incorrect filling of fields

**Suggested Implementations/Fixes**

- When Creating Case Studies, negatives are allowed in the grade box
- Save all button on various ED pages, currently wipes content in boxes not being saved
- Perhaps ranks should have to be different? (Debatable)
- TA Still has Create and Edit/Delete Course Options (Unless I am mistaken shouldn’t be that way
- Make text below grading on dashboard (e.g. “Out of x”) bigger
- (Suggestion) -> On deontology screen, clicking on the text before the boxes causes cursor to pop up, to make more accessible could have clicking on text check the box as well, since tick box is quite small (if possible to implement)
- Half marks for grading? (e.g. allow decimals)
