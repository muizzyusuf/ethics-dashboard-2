    • Radhi- Started implemented client feedback + Identified Questions about plagiarism detection for client

    • Muizz- Continued bug fixing + bouncing balls implementations 

• Blockers + Surprises : 

 - Continuing bug fixing and feedback implementation, no roadblocks so far but realized there was a mention of plagiarism detection in the proposal that we had not asked the client about before, and we have a pseudo-solution that could provide a framework for plagiarism detection that is already implementable but would like to ask the client what she thinks of it this week.

• Possible resolution strategies for moving forward : 

 - Speaking with client about plagiarism detection and if it is expected/at what level would be acceptable.

1. Plan  
Task for this week:  
• Everyone will be continue to be working on bug fixing/implementation of different feedback from peer testing. Aside from general bug testing and UI/design improvement, Muizz is continuing work on the "bouncing balls" idea while Michael works on expanding the export function to include the class, and if this turns out to not be possible he will begin implementing the entry summary export to create the framework for  potential plagiarism detection.


Learning activities proposed for this week:

Goals for the next milestone:  
1. To implement all bug fixes and feedback from peer testing.
2. Demonstrate our progress to the client and present the user feedback for her own knowledge. (Completed)
