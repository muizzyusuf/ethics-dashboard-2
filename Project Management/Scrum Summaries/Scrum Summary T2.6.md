• Blockers + Surprises  
• Possible resolution strategies for moving forward : if the changes made are too difficult to implement going forward, we will have to talk about this with our client and hopefully come to a consensus regarding the changes. 
Virtue ethics section - there is one small portion of virtue ethics which has been difficult for the group to implement, we will have a chat about this with the client during our next meeting with them, to see if we can come to a decision regarding this portion. Other than that the section is functional.
