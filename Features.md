               3. “Total board” - keeping track of average pleasure pain input for long and short term per option. 
               4.  “Summary” of inputs, student inputs final ethical decision/course of action
         4. Deontology (inputs)
            1. Using checkbox options, select motivation(s) for each ethical issue option/decision/action
               1. Checkbox options are provided? or users inputs them?
               2. Any inputs selected other than "it's the right thing to do" will lead to hypothetical imperative screen
                  1. Hypothetical Imp. Screens: Lists selected motivations for that option + summary statement
               3. If "it's the right thing to do" is selected it will lead to categorial imperative screen (Should all other options be greyed out/unusable?)
                  1. categorical imperative screen: lists selected motivations for that option + summary statement
                  3. testing categorical imperative screen: (we will have a min. of 1, and max of 3 for the moral laws that can be entered to start with)
                     1. describe moral issues per ethical issue option/action/decision that falls under categorical imperative
                     2. describe moral laws per ethical issue option/action/decision that falls under categorical imperative. How many? max/min?
                        1. for each moral law, test its universalizability & consistency with yes/no checkbox and text input.
                        2. “Summary” box of each moral law and yes/no for universal & consistent. Student inputs final deontological conclusion.
         5. Virtue Ethics (Inputs)
            1. Balance ball feature
               1. Six inputs given? Or does student generate them?
               2. Does it have to be balance ball? Can we implement this however we like? Can it be range balance type of input like [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39070506/javascript-html-two-input-range-field-balance-scale) ? what’s the number in the center?
            2. For each ethical issue option/action/decision, user inputs vices(excess & deficient) and virtue (mean) and then using a slider, indicates where the option lies on the line. 
               1. “summary box” with options ranked by most virtuous, with virtue/vice 
            3. For each stakeholder interest, user inputs vices (excess & deficient) and virtue (mean) and then using a slider, indicates where the option lies on the line. 
               1. Since each stakeholder has multiple interests, are students going to assign virtues and vices for each individual stakeholder interest? That’s a lot since we’re expecting 6-12 stakeholders and how many interests each?
               2.  “summary box” with interests ranked by most virtuous, with virtue/vice 
            4. “Summary” of rankings, student inputs final ethical decision/course of action (selects virtuous option)
         6. Care Ethics (Inputs)
            1. For each ethical issue option/action/decision, rank each stakeholders level of attentiveness, competence and responsiveness using sliders.
            2.  “summary box” measuring each options “duty of care” i.e. average of each stakeholder’s average attentiveness, competence, responsiveness.
            3.  “Summary” of duty of care, student inputs final ethical decision/course of action (selects option with high level duty of care i.e. the moral choice)
         7. Progress
            1. User sees professor’s grading and comments per section:
               1. Ethical issue & options /10
               2. Stakeholders /10
               3.  Utilitarianism /15
               4. Deontology /15
               5.  Virtue ethics /15
               6. Care ethics /15
            2. “Summary box” with total out of 80 and percentage.
            3. Probably should include progress status, to let student know that grade is not finalised and inputs can be edited. Can inputs be edited or is first submission final submission?
            4. Plagiarism Prevention - this feature will produce a detailed report that students will utilize for the their case analyses and various other papers. Any overlapping similarities will result in potential plagiarism.
